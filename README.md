 **# Tic-Tac-Toe Code Along**

**Inspired by Bro Code's Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial on YouTube!**

Welcome to this Tic-Tac-Toe code along! Let's build a simple text-based version of this classic game to practice our C programming skills.

**Before You Begin:**

- **Check out Bro Code's tutorial:** It provides a great walkthrough of the code and concepts involved. You can find it on YouTube here: [https://youtu.be/_889aB2D1KI?si=sKoYlfzZ58z_lqyD](https://youtu.be/_889aB2D1KI?si=sKoYlfzZ58z_lqyD).
- **Basic C knowledge:** You should be familiar with C syntax, variables, functions, and control structures.
- **Compiler:** Have a C compiler set up to run the code.

**Instructions:**

1. **Download the code:** Grab the code from this repository.
2. **Follow along with the tutorial:** Watch Bro Code's tutorial and pause as needed to code along with each step.
3. **Experiment and explore:** Once you have a working game, try modifying the code to add new features or improve its functionality.

**Have fun coding!**

**Project Structure:**

- **main.c:** Contains the main function, game loop, and interaction with the player.
- **helpers.h:** Contains function prototypes for the helper functions used throughout the code.
- **helpers.c:** Implements the helper functions, including those for resetting the board, printing the board, checking for a winner, and making player/computer moves.

**Enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer!**
